**Windows**: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

#### If installed via npm:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tmdb": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "film-data-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "TMDB_ACCESS_TOKEN": "your_tmdb_access_token_here"
      }

      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/film-data-mcp/build/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "TMDB_ACCESS_TOKEN": "your_tmdb_access_token_here"

### With Other MCP Clients

The server runs on stdio by default, making it compatible with any MCP client that supports stdio transport.

### Remote Deployment (HTTP Mode)

The server also supports Streamable HTTP transport for remote deployment:

```bash
MCP_TRANSPORT=http PORT=3000 node build/index.js
```

See [TRANSPORT.md](TRANSPORT.md) for detailed deployment instructions for platforms like Railway.

## Development

### Local Development

Run the server in watch mode for development:
```bash
npm run watch
```

### Debugging

Use the MCP Inspector for debugging:
```bash
npm run inspector
```

The Inspector provides a web interface for testing and debugging MCP tools.
